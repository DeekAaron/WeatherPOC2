# Changelog

All notable changes to WeatherPOC2 are recorded here. The **why** matters as much as the **what**.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-07-22

### Added
- `LiveOpenMeteoTests` — a trait-gated (`[Trait("Tier","2-Live")]`) Tier-2 live drift-guard test
  that makes one real call to `api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast` for `Location.LondonGb` through the
  real `OpenMeteoGateway`. It guards against the recorded Tier-1 fixtures drifting from the live
  Open-Meteo contract. The assertion is unit-aware by construction: the Gateway throws
  `WeatherUnavailableException` unless `current_units.temperature_2m == "°C"`, so a returned bundle
  proves the live response is in canonical Celsius — a server-side unit-default change fails the
  test rather than slipping past a loose plausibility band (a −60…60 sanity band sits on top).

### Changed
- Test runs are now split by trait so the live test never runs per-commit:
  `dotnet test --filter "Tier!=2-Live"` is the per-commit command (no network dependency) and
  `dotnet test --filter "Tier=2-Live"` is the scheduled (daily) job. Cost ceiling recorded in-file:
  ≤ 5 live calls per scheduled run, once per day — Open-Meteo is free and keyless, so the ceiling is
  call-volume, not money.

### Fixed
- `WeatherPoc2.App` Windows head now builds unpackaged: added
  `<WindowsPackageType>None</WindowsPackageType>` (Windows-conditioned) to `WeatherPoc2.App.csproj`.
  The app carries no `Platforms/Windows` AppxManifest, so the Windows build previously failed with
  *"no AppxManifest is specified, but WindowsPackageType is not set to MSIX."* Surfaced by the HITL
  platform-verification story (#38) — the Linux AFK runner cannot build either desktop head, so this
  config gap could only be caught by a human building on Windows.

### Decisions
- No pipeline or schedule wiring is included — explicitly out of scope for this story and this
  Feature per the Plan. The trait is what makes the per-commit/scheduled split possible; the actual
  schedule lands later with the Feature's CI setup. This keeps the ratchet's seam-drift guard in the
  test suite now, without coupling the story to CI infrastructure that isn't this Feature's concern.
